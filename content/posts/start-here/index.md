Open `config.toml`, change `theme` to `"paper"`:

```

For more information, please read the [official guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-3-add-a-theme) of Hugo.

## Options

```toml
disqusShortname = 'YOUR_DISQUS_SHORTNAME'   # add disqus comments

## Extra Features

### Responsive

This theme is designed to look great on both large-screen and small-screen (mobile) devices.

### Syntax highlighting

This theme has support for either Hugo's lightning fast Chroma, or both server side and client side highlighting. See [the Hugo docs for more](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).

### Disqus support

To use this feature, uncomment and fill out the `disqusShortname` parameter in `config.toml`.

### Google Analytics

To add Google Analytics, simply sign up to [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) to obtain your Google Tracking ID, and add this tracking ID to the `googleAnalytics` parameter in `config.toml`.

Note that the Google Analytics tracking code will only be inserted into the page when the site isn't served on Hugo's built-in server, to prevent tracking from local testing environments.

### Commit SHA on the footer

If the source of your site is in a Git repo, the SHA corresponding to the commit the site is built from can be shown on the footer. To do so, two site parameters `commit` has to be defined in the config file `config.toml`:

```
enableGitInfo = true
[Params]
  commit = "https://github.com/<username>/<siterepo>/tree/"
```

See at [vincenttam/vincenttam.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/vincenttam/vincenttam.gitlab.io) for an example of how to add it to a continuous integration system.

### Multilingual

To allow Beautiful Hugo to go multilingual, you need to define the languages
you want to use inside the `languages` parameter on `config.toml` file, also
redefining the content dir for each one. Check the `i18n/` folder to see all
languages available.

```toml
[languages]
  [languages.en] 
    contentDir = "content/en" # English
  [languages.ja]
    contentDir = "content/ja" # Japanese
  [languages.br]
    contentDir = "content/br" # Brazilian Portuguese
```

Now you just need to create a subdir within the `content/` folder for each
language and just put stuff inside `page/` and `post/` regular directories.
```
content/      content/      content/  
└── en/       └── br/       └── ja/ 
    ├── page/     ├── page/     ├── page/
    └── post/     └── post/     └── post/

```
 
### Extra shortcodes

There are two extra shortcodes provided (along with the customized figure shortcode):

## About

This is an adaptation of the Hugo theme [Arberia](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) by [Vincenzo Antedoro](https://antedoro.it/contatti/). It supports most of the features of the original theme, and many new features. It has diverged from the Jekyll theme over time, with years of community updates.
